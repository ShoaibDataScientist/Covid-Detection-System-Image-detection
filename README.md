# Covid Detection System(Image detection)
 This study is focused on presenting an approach based on deep learning
approach for detecting COVID-19 infection with the aid of X-ray images of chest. For classifying three
types of pneumonia, we proposed a deep neural network (CNN). Our research deals with the
classification of v COVID-19 pneumonia or normal. We have named our proposed model as ResNet and
it will help us in differentiating different types of pneumonia. Doctors find the model very useful in
diagnosing, quantifying, and following up the positive COVID19 cases that is based on radiography
images of chest. The proposed model may not become an alternate to the current existing method
completely, but number of cases can still be brought down where an immediate based testing or further
review from experts is required

# Dataset
Data acts as a fuel in deep learning for training of models. COVID-19 virus
initially appeared in December 2019, and it has affected people around the globe, no effective size
dataset is available to conduct a research. To stimulate our work, we have used dataset from Kaggle
following this link https://www.kaggle.com/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset. Researchers from
different regions update this database regularly. The Dataset have 137 images of COVID-19 and 317 in
containing Viral Pneumonia and Normal Chest X-Rays structured into the test and train folders
